# Single-Cell RNA Sequencing of Brain Metastases in Mouse Models
Here we re-analyse a data set [published](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/abstract/S1535-6108(24)00314-3) in the group of J. Massague.

The experimental setup contains sorted cancer cells from (brain-tropic variants of triple-negative breast cancer model MDA231 and HER2+ HCC1954), labeled tumor microenvironment (mouse cells in proximity of the cancer cells) and unlabelled mouse cells from the brain. Samples from both cell lines were pooled for sequencing and using antibody-based HTOs for demultiplexing.
